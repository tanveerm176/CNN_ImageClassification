We were tasked with building an image classifier that would be able to classify images to 5 classes with above 85% accuracy. The dataset consisted of 22500 images all equally distributed within the following classes: bell, dog, horse, house, and tiger. The dataset was further stratified into train, test, and validate sets.
Our final model achieved 90% accuracy on the holdout test set. In each stage of this project, we iterated upon our best models, making sure that each team member experimented with parallel parameters of the model to ensure that models could be combined at the end of each stage.
